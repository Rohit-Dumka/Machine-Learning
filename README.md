# Machine-Learning

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository on GitHub! This repository serves as a centralized hub for all the information, code, and resources related to my journey in the world of machine learning. Whether you're a fellow learner, a collaborator, or just someone curious about the field, you're in the right place.

## Overview

 This repository is my personal space for documenting and sharing the knowledge and projects I undertake as I dive deeper into the world of machine learning.

## About Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It has a wide range of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more.

In this repository, I plan to explore various aspects of machine learning, including:<br><br>

Supervised learning<br>
Unsupervised learning<br>
Deep learning<br>
Reinforcement learning<br>
Natural language processing<br>
Computer vision<br>
And more!<br>
